# Introduction
QSchematic is a library to draw diagrams & schematics with Qt. It uses Qt's [graphics view framework](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/graphicsview.html).

The library provides base classes for objects such as nodes and wires and implements logic to move objects around while keeping the wires connected, generating netlists and so on. A typical application would include this library and subclass the `Item` class to implement custom items.

Feature overview:
  - Add, remove, move, resize nodes
  - Connect nodes with wires
  - Undo/redo
  - Generate netlists
  - Serialization to/from JSON
  - Completely customizable by inheriting from the provided classes

Technical stuff:
  - Written in C++
  - Everything is contained within the `QSchematic` namespace
  - Tested with Qt5
  - No dependencies other than Qt5 and a C++11 compatible compiler
  - BSD 3-clause licensed

# State
This library is currently under heavy development.

# Licensing
The entire library is BSD 3-clause licensed.

# Credits
Special thank goes to Professor Fran√ßois Corthay (Switzerland) for initially privately funding this project.

# Architecture
Did someone say UML?!

The class diagramm below shows the overall architecture of the system:

All items that are part of the `Scene` inherit from the `Item` class. There are built-in specialized classes for nodes, wires and so on:
